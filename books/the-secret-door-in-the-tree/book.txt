Chapter 1: A Quiet Afternoon

Mia was 22 years old. She lived alone in a small town and worked at a flower shop. After work, she liked to walk in the park. It was quiet, with tall trees and singing birds. Mia didn’t talk much — she just listened.
One evening, she saw something strange. In the biggest tree near the lake, there was a small wooden door. It looked old, with no handle, and it stood half open.
Mia looked around. No one was there.
She stepped closer and touched the door. It felt warm.
She took a deep breath… and walked inside.
It wasn’t dark. A soft, golden light came from within.
Suddenly, a white dove flew down and landed near her. Its feathers sparkled like snow in sunlight.
“Welcome,” the dove said gently.
Mia froze. “You can… talk?”
The dove nodded. “Only kind hearts can find this place. This is the Garden Between Time.”
Mia looked around. Trees glowed, flowers hummed, and the air smelled like honey and wind.
She didn’t say a word. But deep inside, something opened — like a quiet light.
She knew this was not a dream.
This place was real.
And somehow… it felt like home.


Chapter 2: The Garden Between Time

Mia followed the dove. Soft green grass was under her feet. The trees had golden leaves, and the sky was pink like morning light.
“Where am I?” Mia asked.
“You are in the Garden Between Time,” the dove said. “It is a quiet place for hearts that feel lost or tired.”
Mia looked around. Glowing flowers opened and closed like they were breathing. Tiny lights danced in the air. A small stream sang a soft song.
Mia smiled. “It’s beautiful.”
The dove flew to a large tree with silver fruit. “Eat one,” the dove said. “It won’t fill your body—but it will feed your spirit.”
Mia picked one fruit. It was warm in her hand. She took a bite. It tasted like sunshine and peace.
Farther ahead, she saw something strange—books flying like birds, pages turning in the wind.
“Do they fly?” she asked.
“They carry stories to those who need them,” the dove said.
Mia reached out, and one book came to her. Its cover said: "For Mia, who still believes in wonder."
She held the book close. “I do believe,” she whispered.
The dove smiled. “Then your journey has just begun.”
And the garden seemed to open even more.


Chapter 3: The Mirror Tree

Mia walked slowly. The garden was full of soft light. She saw a tree with silver bark. It looked like a mirror. In the mirror, she saw herself—but different. Her hair looked neat. Her smile was big. She wore a dress and a hat. Next to the tree, a cat slept on a soft blanket. A book was open on a bench.
Mia asked, “What is this tree?”
The dove said, “This is the Mirror Tree. It shows who you can be.”
Mia saw a child in the mirror, holding a balloon. A brother and sister played with a ball. A mother baked bread. A man painted with a brush. A birthday cake stood on a table with candles. There was music and dancing.
“Is that me?” Mia asked.
“Yes,” said the dove. “That is your possible future.”
Mia smiled. “It looks fun.”
She picked up the book from the bench. It had a red cover and gold letters. The title was: 'You Are Brave.'
Mia opened it. The first page said: 'You are a lucky person.'


Chapter 4: The Clock Room

Mia and the dove walked again. They came to a tall, quiet building. It looked like a tower. The door was open.
Inside, Mia saw many clocks. Big clocks, small clocks. Some had numbers. Some had none.
But all the clocks were still. They did not move. They made no sound.
“Why are they quiet?” Mia asked.
“This is the Clock Room,” said the dove. “Time stops here. You can rest.”
Mia sat on a soft cushion. She closed her eyes.
She saw her mother’s smile. She saw her old dog. She heard a song from long ago.
Mia opened her eyes. She felt warm and safe.
A small clock near her went tick. Just one sound.
Mia smiled. “I remember,” she said.
“Good,” the dove said. “Now you are ready for more.”


Chapter 5: The Boy and the River

They walked near a river. It was blue and calm. A boy sat on a rock. He looked at the water. He looked sad.
Mia sat near him. “Hello,” she said.
He looked at her. “Can you see me?”
“Yes,” Mia said kindly.
The boy said, “I forgot my name. I don’t remember who I am.”
Mia thought for a moment. Then she smiled. “Can I give you a name?”
“Yes,” the boy said.
“I will call you Elan. It means ‘life,’” she said.
The boy smiled a little. “Thank you.”
The wind moved the trees. A bird sang.
Mia and Elan sat quietly. They did not talk. But both of them felt better.
“I want to stay here,” said Elan.
Mia said, “I hope we meet again.”


Chapter 6: The Door Again

Mia walked with the dove one more time. They went back to the first tree — the one with the small wooden door.
The door was now closed, but it glowed softly. It looked safe.
“You can go home now,” said the dove.
Mia looked around. She saw the silver tree. She saw the tower. She saw the river. She thought about Elan.
“Will I remember all this?” she asked.
“You will remember with your heart,” said the dove.
Mia smiled. “Thank you for everything.”
She opened the door. A soft light came out. She walked through.
Now she was back in the park. The sun was low. The birds were singing.
Everything looked the same—but Mia felt different.
She looked at the sky and touched her heart.
The garden was gone. But a part of it stayed inside her.
