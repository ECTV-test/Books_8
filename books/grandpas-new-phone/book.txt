Grandpa’s New Phone


Chapter 1: The Birthday Gift

It was Grandpa's birthday. He turned 75. 
His grandchildren, Leo and Anna, came to visit. They brought a big box. 
“Open it!” said Anna. Grandpa opened the box. Inside was a shiny new smartphone. “What is this?” Grandpa asked. “It’s your new phone,” said Leo. “Now you can call us, send pictures, and play games!” Grandpa looked confused. 
“But I like my old phone. It has buttons.”
“This one is better,” said Anna. 
“It can do many things.” Grandpa smiled. 
“Okay, let’s try.” Anna showed him how to turn it on. The screen was bright.
“Tap here,” she said. 
“And swipe here,” added Leo. Grandpa said, “Swipe? How?” Everyone laughed. 
Grandpa tapped the screen. It beeped. “Oh! It talks!” he said. “Yes,” said Anna. 
“It’s smart!” Grandpa touched the camera. He saw his face. “I look funny,” he said. He took a picture.
“Smile!” said Leo. They all smiled. Click! Grandpa’s first selfie! He looked proud.
“This is fun,” he said. “But how do I call your grandma?” “One step at a time,” said Anna.
Grandpa laughed. “Okay. Let’s keep going.”


Chapter 2: The First Call

The next morning, Grandpa sat with the new phone. 
He wanted to call Grandma. He looked at the screen. “Where are the numbers?” he asked. 
He pressed a button and saw many apps. “Hmm… I need help.” He called Anna. 
“Anna, how do I call your grandma?” he asked. “Press the green phone icon,” said Anna.
“Then choose Grandma’s name.” Grandpa looked. “I found it!” he said.
He tapped on her name. Ring… Ring… Grandma answered. “Hello?” she said.
“It’s me!” said Grandpa. “Oh, you did it!” said Grandma.
Grandpa smiled. “This new phone is smart, but I’m smarter.” Grandma laughed.
“Don’t press the red button until you say goodbye.” “Got it,” said Grandpa.
He talked to Grandma for ten minutes. After the call, he felt happy.
“This is not so hard,” he said. He opened the camera again. He took a photo of his breakfast: toast, eggs, and tea.
He sent it to Leo. Leo sent back a smiley face. Grandpa laughed. “I’m learning fast!” He sat back and smiled. 


Chapter 3: The Emoji Trouble

One day, Grandpa wanted to send a message to Anna.
He typed: “Good morning.” Then he saw a smiley face.
“What’s this?” he asked. He clicked it. Many little faces and pictures appeared.
“Wow! So many!” Grandpa liked the cat face, the dancing man, and the pizza.
He sent them all to Anna. Anna laughed. “Grandpa, why did you send me 20 emojis?” “I like them!” he said.
“They are small and fun!” Later, Grandpa sent a message to Grandma. He wanted to say, “I love you.” But he picked the wrong emoji.
Instead of a heart, he sent a crying face and a ghost. Grandma replied, “Are you okay?” Grandpa looked again. 
“Oh no! Wrong emoji!” He laughed and sent a big red heart. 
“Much better,” said Grandma. Grandpa told Leo, “Emojis are like a new language!” Leo said, “Yes, but you must learn the right ones!” Grandpa nodded.
“I will try.” That night, he watched a video about emojis. 
“There’s one for everything!” he said. He sent Anna a cake emoji. 
She replied with balloons. Grandpa was learning, one emoji at a time.


Chapter 4: The Lost Phone

One morning, Grandpa looked for his phone. 
It was not on the table. Not on the couch. Not in his coat. 
“Where is it?” he asked. He checked the kitchen. He checked the bathroom. 
No phone. He asked Grandma, “Have you seen my phone?” “No,” she said. 
“Did you check the fridge?” “Why would it be in the fridge?” Grandpa laughed. 
He opened the fridge. There it was — next to the milk! “Oh no! I must be going crazy,” he said. 
Grandma laughed. “You put it there after breakfast.” “Maybe the phone was hungry,” said Grandpa. He wiped the phone. 
“Still works!” he said. Grandpa told Leo, “I need something to help me find my phone.” Leo said, “Ask your phone to ring!” Grandpa tried. 
“Phone, ring!” Nothing happened. “You need to press a button,” said Anna. Grandpa smiled. 
“Or maybe I’ll tie a string to it!” Everyone laughed. 
Grandpa made a sign: “Don’t eat the phone!” He put it on the fridge. From that day, he always checked his pockets. 
“Smartphones are smart,” he said, “but they don’t stay in one place!”


Chapter 5: Grandpa the Photographer

Grandpa liked the phone’s camera. 
He took photos of his breakfast. He took pictures of his garden. 
He took a selfie with Grandma. “Smile!” he said. The photos looked nice. 
“I’m an artist now,” said Grandpa. “You’re a phone-tographer!” said Leo. Grandpa laughed. 
“Yes! A phone-tographer!” One day, he went to the park. He took pictures of birds, flowers, and clouds. 
He saw a squirrel. Click! Then he saw a boy flying a kite. 
Click! “These pictures are good,” he said. Back home, he showed Grandma the photos. “Beautiful,” she said. “You should share them.” Grandpa opened a photo app. 
He posted a photo of a tree with a rainbow. Anna saw it. 
“Grandpa, your photo is amazing!” she said. Grandpa smiled. 
“I used a good filter!” He took more photos the next day. 
He even made a folder called “My Art.” “This phone is fun,” Grandpa said. “It’s like a magic eye.” “Maybe you’ll get an award,” joked Grandma. 
“Or become famous!” Grandpa laughed. “One photo at a time!”


Chapter 6: Grandpa’s Video Call

One evening, Anna said, “Let’s have a video call!” Grandpa asked, “A what?” “You can see us and talk at the same time!” said Leo. 
“Like TV?” asked Grandpa. “Yes, but you’re on the TV too!” said Anna. 
They showed Grandpa how. He pressed the video icon. Soon, Anna and Leo appeared on the screen. 
“Hello, Grandpa!” they said. Grandpa waved. “I see you!” “We see you too!” said Leo. “Nice shirt!” said Anna. 
“You like my dancing?” Grandpa asked. He stood up and danced. 
The kids laughed. Grandma waved from the kitchen. “Hi, Grandma!” said the kids. Grandpa smiled. 
“This is the best call ever.” He showed them his garden. He showed them a cake he baked. “We miss you,” said Anna. 
“I miss you too,” said Grandpa. The call ended. Grandpa sat quietly. He looked at the phone. 
“This little thing connects hearts,” he said. 
“It’s more than a phone.” He took one more selfie. 
This time, he was smiling. Not for the camera — but for love.
