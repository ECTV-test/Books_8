Match Made in Mistake


Chapter 1: The Wrong Match

Lily was 22 years old. She lived in a small town. She worked at a bookshop. Lily liked quiet places and soft music. She loved tea, books, and rainy days.
Lily did not like dating. But one day, her friend said, “Try this new dating app! It’s easy and fun.”
Lily said, “Okay, I’ll try… just once.”
She made a profile:
“Hi, I’m Lily. I like reading and cats. Looking for someone kind and calm.”
The next day, the app showed a match. His name was Jack. His profile said:
“I love rock music, fast cars, and junk food!”
Lily frowned. “This is not right. We are too different.”
She wanted to delete the match. But then Jack sent a message:
“Hey, I think we are a mistake. Want to meet and laugh about it?”
Lily smiled. “Hmm… maybe just one coffee.”
They agreed to meet on Saturday at 4 PM.
Lily told her cat, “It’s just one coffee. Nothing will happen.”
But she did not know… this small mistake would change everything.


Chapter 2: The Coffee Shop

Saturday came. Lily wore her favourite blue sweater. She was nervous but excited. “It’s just coffee,” she told herself again.
The coffee shop was small and quiet. Lily came early and sat by the window. She ordered tea and looked at the door.
At 4:05, the door opened. A tall, handsome man walked in. He had dark brown hair and wore a leather jacket. It was Jack. 
He smiled and waved. “Hi! You must be Lily.”
Lily stood up and smiled a little. “Yes. You’re Jack?”
Jack laughed. “Yep. The wrong match!”
They both sat down.
“I thought this was a mistake,” Lily said.
“Me too,” Jack said. “You like books and tea. I like rock music, fast cars, and junk food.”
Lily smiled. “Maybe we don’t match, but we can talk.”
They talked about simple things: music, food, the weather.
Jack said, “I don’t read much, but I like stories about space.”
Lily said, “That’s cool. I read one last week!”
Time went fast. After one hour, Jack said, “I’m glad we met. You’re fun to talk to.”
Lily was surprised. “Me too. You’re not what I expected.”
Jack smiled. “Same here.”
They both looked at the time. It was 5:30 already.
“Want to meet again?” Jack asked.
Lily paused… then nodded. “Yes. Why not?”


Chapter 3: The Animal Shelter

One week later, Lily sent a message:
“Would you like to visit the animal shelter with me? I help there on Sundays.”
Jack replied:
“Sure. I like animals… I think.”
They met at the shelter at 11 AM.
Lily smiled and waved. “Hi again!”
Jack smiled back. “Hi, Lily. Good to see you.”
They walked inside. There were many cats, dogs, and some rabbits.
The animals made noise, but Lily looked happy.
Jack asked, “Do you have any pets?”
Lily smiled. “Yes. I have a cat. Her name is Mimi. She’s a cute ginger cat.”
Jack asked, “Where did you get her?”
Lily looked at one quiet corner of the shelter. “From here. Many years ago. She was small, sick, and scared. I adopted the kitten and took her home. Now she’s happy and strong.”
She paused for a moment. “I want to tell you something else. I’m vegan. I don’t eat meat or use things from animals. But… I don’t tell many people. Some laugh. Some don’t understand.”
Jack was quiet. Then he said, “I had a dog. His name was Max. He was my best friend. He died when I was young. It hurt so much. Since then, I couldn’t even look at animals. It made me too sad.”
He looked around the shelter. Then he looked at Lily.
“But today… I feel different. My heart feels a little warm again.”
He smiled. “Thank you, Lily. This was a good day. I’d be happy to meet you again.”


Chapter 4: The Picnic Plan

On Friday, Jack sent Lily a message:
“Hey! Want to meet at Crazy Buns Café tomorrow? It’s a fun place. Best burgers in town!”
Lily looked at the message. She felt nervous.
She replied:
“Jack… I’m not sure about that place. They sell only meat. And… you never said how you felt when I told you I’m vegan.”
Jack replied quickly:
“Oh! I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to ignore that. Actually… your words made me think.”
He sent another message:
“I started reading about vegan food. I even tried a veggie meal this week. It was good! I want to try more. I think it’s cool that you care about animals.”
Lily smiled.
Then Jack sent:
“How about a picnic? No meat. Just veggies, fruit, and fresh air. There’s a park near the lake. We can meet tomorrow?”
Lily replied:
“That sounds perfect.”
The next day, they met in the park. Jack brought a basket with carrots, apples, sandwiches with hummus, and lemonade.
“This is amazing,” Lily said. “You really brought all vegan food.”
They sat on a blanket under a big tree. The sun was warm, and the sky was blue.
Then Lily looked up and said, “Jack… look!”
In the sky, clouds formed a shape that looked like a heart. Just a soft, white heart floating above them.
Jack laughed. “Wow. Is that a sign?”
Lily smiled. “Maybe it is.”
They sat quietly, smiling at the sky.


Chapter 5: Climbing Up

One week later, Jack sent Lily a message:
“Let’s do something cool this Saturday. Meet me at ClimbZone!”
Lily searched online.
“Indoor climbing? That looks high… and scary,” she thought.
But she replied:
“Okay! I’ll try. But I might be bad at it!”
On Saturday, they met at the climbing centre.
Jack smiled. “Hi, Lily! Ready to climb?”
Lily laughed nervously. “Maybe…”
They put on helmets and ropes. The climbing wall looked big.
“You go first,” Lily said.
Jack started climbing. “Come on, it’s fun!”
Lily started slowly.
“My hands are shaking!” she said.
Jack called, “Just one step at a time. You’re safe.”
Lily moved up, little by little.
“I’m doing it!” she said, surprised.
Soon she was halfway up.
She laughed. “I never thought I’d like this!”
After the climb, they sat on soft bean bags.
“I was so scared at first,” Lily said. “But now I feel strong.”
Jack smiled. “You were amazing up there.”
She looked at him. “Thank you for helping me.”
Jack looked at the wall. “Next time, we try that one.”
Lily laughed. “Maybe!”
They left the centre with happy hearts and tired legs — and one more special memory together.


Chapter 6: Just Us and the Ducks

The next weekend, Jack and Lily met at the lake.
The sky was blue, and the water was calm. Ducks swam close to the shore.
“Hi, Jack,” Lily said. “I brought some bread for the ducks.”
They sat on a bench and threw small pieces into the water.
The ducks quacked happily.
They walked along the lake slowly. The trees moved in the wind.
“It’s so peaceful here,” Jack said.
Lily looked at him. “I want to thank you.”
“For what?” he asked.
“For everything. Before I met you, I was afraid of many things. Now… I enjoy climbing, trying new places, and even falling,” she smiled.
Jack laughed. “You’re brave, Lily.”
She smiled. “And you? You didn’t laugh when I said I’m vegan. You even made a vegan picnic.”
Jack nodded. “I’ve been eating more plants now. It’s not hard. I feel good. I think I’m slowly becoming vegan like you.”
They stopped near the water.
Lily said, “Now we have more things in common.”
Jack looked into her eyes. “Yes. A few weeks ago, we were strangers. But now… I can’t imagine my life without you.”
Lily’s eyes sparkled. “Me too.”
They held hands and stood together by the lake.
A soft breeze passed by. The ducks swam in a circle, like they were dancing.
The sky was full of light. It felt like a quiet, beautiful promise.
They didn’t say anything more. They just smiled and watched the world around them — together.
